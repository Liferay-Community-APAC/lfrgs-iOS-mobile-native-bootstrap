A step-by-step tutorial and reference app for building a **native iOS (SwiftUI) app on
Liferay DXP 2026.Q1**, using only Liferay's headless REST APIs:

- Sign in a Liferay self-service user with **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code + PKCE**.
- **CRUD on out-of-the-box system objects**: the user's own profile and postal addresses.
- **CRUD on a custom Liferay Object**: `Service Request`, with each user seeing only their own.
- **No third-party dependencies**: `URLSession`, `CryptoKit`, `AuthenticationServices` and the Keychain.

Liferay Screens and the Mobile SDK were retired in 7.4. Liferay's guidance is to build native apps on
the headless APIs, but there was no end-to-end example. This is one.

**Start here: [00 — Introduction](docs/tutorial/00-introduction.md).** The plan, architecture and decisions are in [`docs/TUTORIAL_OUTLINE.md`](docs/TUTORIAL_OUTLINE.md).

## Quick start (Liferay side)

Requirements: Docker (6 GB+ memory), `curl` and `jq`.

```bash
cd liferay
docker compose up -d        # Liferay DXP 2026.Q1 on http://localhost:8080 (admin: test@liferay.com / test)
./scripts/setup.sh          # Service Request object, permissions, users jane.doe and john.roe
./scripts/smoke-test.sh     # verifies every API call the app uses
```

Then create the OAuth 2 application as described in [chapter 02, step 3](docs/tutorial/02-configure-liferay.md#3-create-the-oauth-2-application).

## Things that will surprise you (all covered in the chapters)

- Regular users **can't authorize an OAuth 2 app** until their role has *View* and *Create Token* on it.
- There is **no POST for a user's postal address**: you PATCH the user account with the full list.
- An **unknown picklist key returns `403 Forbidden`**, not a validation error.
- **PATCH ignores `null`**, so clearing a field needs PUT; an empty Integer field comes back as `0`.
- Address endpoints only agree on the **English country name**; an empty country is saved as *Afghanistan*.
- Liferay 2026.Q1 has **no OAuth token revocation endpoint**, so sign-out is done on the device.
- The Docker image's pre-built database forces an admin password change, so the tutorial uses a fresh one.
